# Estimating parameters for epidemic models from viral load data collected when infections are rising at an exponential rate.

Here I present a summary of one of my PhD projects, which was to was to estimate the parameters of epidemic models given one had access to the the rate of exponential growth of infections during the beginning of an epidemic $r$ and data of people's viral loads. We demonstrate with a classic SIR model:
